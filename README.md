In Part 1, I used automated browsing to scrape titles and preview text from the Mars News website. After creating a Beautiful Soup object to parse the HTML, I extracted the relevant information, stored each title-and-preview pair in Python dictionaries, and stored all dictionaries in a list.
In Part 2, I visited the Mars Temperature Data site, used Beautiful Soup to scrape data from an HTML table, and assembled the data into a Pandas DataFrame with specific column headings. I analyzed the dataset using Pandas to answer questions about the Martian weather, such as the number of months on Mars, Martian days worth of data, coldest and warmest months, lowest and highest atmospheric pressure months, and the Earth days in a Martian year. I also plotted relevant data as bar charts and exported the DataFrame to a CSV file.
